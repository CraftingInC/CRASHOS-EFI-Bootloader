**STATUS**  
    This code is setup for a loader / kernel to begin it's development. RSDP has been added to access hardware. The GDT is called from within the EFI file itself, AFTER the Exit Boot Services has been called. I made this on a whim, but I will not be continuing it do to my goals have changed.
